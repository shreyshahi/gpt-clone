# gpt-clone

Trying to train a small gpt-2 type model from scratch after watching Karpathy's videos

The only purpose is to revise writing pytorch models from scratch as I have not used pytorch in a few years.

If you are looking for a simple gpt clone to learn please go to [karpathy's nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT)
